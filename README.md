**Displaying and Navigation**

- [ ] The display of content is determined by the group assigned to each individual user. Depending on their assigned group, clients are able to view pages and templates that showcase chefs' profiles and menus associated with them. On the other hand, chefs have the ability to add or edit menus that they offer to customers.</br>

## Database Model

**User and Chef:** The relationship (one-to-one) between the Chef and Customer models with the built-in Django's User model is established primarily for authentication and authorization purposes. If a User is deleted, the associated Chef will be deleted too due to the 'on_delete=models.CASCADE' option.

**User and Customer:** models have a one-to-one relationship. The implication is the same as the relationship between User and Chef.

**Chef and Menu:** this is a one-to-many relationship where one Chef can have multiple Menu instances but each Menu is associated with one Chef. If a Chef is deleted, all associated Menu instances will be deleted too.

**Menu and MenuCategory:** A ForeignKey relationship exists between the Menu and MenuCategory models. This means each Menu can have one MenuCategory, but a MenuCategory can be associated with many Menu objects. If a MenuCategory is deleted, the Menu objects associated with it will not be deleted; instead, their menu_category fields (which is the ForeignKey to MenuCategory) will be set to NULL due to the on_delete=models.SET_NULL setting.

**Menu and Dish:** This is a one-to-many relationship. One Menu can have many Dish instances but each Dish is associated with one Menu. If a Menu is deleted, all related Dish instances are also deleted.

**Customer and Booking:** This is a one-to-many relationship. One Customer can have multiple Booking instances but each Booking is associated with one Customer. If a Customer is deleted, all of their Booking instances are also deleted.

**Menu and Booking:** This is another one-to-many relationship. One Menu can have multiple Booking instances but each Booking is associated with one Menu. If a Menu is deleted, all related Booking instances are also deleted.

**Chef and Deal:** This is a one-to-many relationship. One Chef can create multiple Deal instances, but each Deal is associated with one Chef. If a Chef is deleted, all related Deal instances are also deleted.

**Customer and Review:** This is a one-to-many relationship. One Customer can write multiple Review instances, but each Review is associated with one and only one Customer. If a Customer is deleted, all of their Review instances are also deleted due to the on_delete=models.CASCADE argument.

**Chef and Review:** This is another one-to-many relationship. One Chef can have multiple Review instances, but each Review is associated with one and only one Chef. If a Chef is deleted, all related Review instances are also deleted due to the on_delete=models.CASCADE argument.

## Admin specific actions

**Add menu category:**
Admin-only add menu categories simplify search and sorting while preventing an excessive number of categories for users.

Nice to have:

- [ ] Chef can request specific category addition.
